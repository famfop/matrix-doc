The sequence of steps describes an example of how to set up a Space in Element Web.

1. In the user interface, Spaces are displayed in the first left column. There you will find the plus icon **"Create new Space "** below all previous Spaces, you may have to scroll to the end of the list first. Click on the plus icon.

2. The dialog "Create new Space" opens. Here you can now select the type of Space: The button "Public" creates a [public Space](#public-space), "Private" creates a [private](#private-space) or [personal Space](#personal-space).

## Public Space

3. The "Your public space" dialog opens. Here you can upload a photo by clicking on the "Upload" link. The file manager of your operating system will open where you can select the appropriate file. Enter a name, the address and a description in the respective fields of the same name. The name can be freely assigned, for the unique address a suggestion is automatically created based on the name. If the address text field is activated, a tooltip shows the availability of the address. If everything is entered according to your wishes, "Create" the Space by selecting the button of the same name.
