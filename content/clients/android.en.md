## Element X

You may find the app 'Element X' in the Play-Store. This app is not ready for production and does not work with our matrix server.

## Setup

1. After opening the Element app for the first time, select **"I already have an account"**. You will then be prompted to select a server.

4. Enter your ZIH login in the **"User name or e-mail address"** field. (You will find your ZIH login in the [profile of the Self-Service Portal](https://selfservice.tu-dresden.de/profile/) in the Account Information section as "Login user name".) After entering your ZIH password in the second field, you can log in using the **"Login"** button.
